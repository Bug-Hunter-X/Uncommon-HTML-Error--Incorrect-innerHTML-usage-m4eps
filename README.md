This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can easily be missed. The error occurs when using the innerHTML property of a DOM element and attempting to assign a non-string value to it, such as a number. This error may not always produce a visible error message, but it can cause unexpected results or prevent JavaScript code from working properly. The solution involves ensuring that any value passed to innerHTML is converted to a string. Please refer to the bug.html and bugSolution.html files for code examples.
